# CryptoClustering

![Alt Text](./Resources/crypto.png)

## DESCRIPTION
- In this challenge, we'll try use to predict if cryptocurrencies are affected by 24-hour or 7-day price changes using Python and unsupervised learning.

### INSTRUCTIONS 
- Load the crypto_market_data.csv into a DataFrame.
- Get the summary statistics and plot the data to see what the data looks like before proceeding.

#### PREPARE THE DATA
- Use the 'StandardScaler()' module from 'scikit-learn' to normalize the data from the CSV file.
- Create a DataFrame with the scaled data and set the "coin_id" index from the original DataFrame as the index for the new DataFrame

#### FIND THE BEST VALUE FOR k USING THE ORIGINAL SCALED DATAFRAME 

#### CLUSTERING CRYPTOCURRENCIES WITH K-MEANS USING THE ORIGINAL SCALED DATA

#### OPTIMIZE CLUSTERS WITH PRINCIPAL COMPONENT ANALYSIS

#### FIND THE BEST VALUE FOR k USING THE PCA DATA

#### CLUSTER CRYPTOCURRENCIES WITH K-MEANS USING THE PCA DATA
